# Examination-of-the-Dallas-Policing-Dataset
Recently involved in a significant data visualization project in collaboration with the Center for Policing Equity, the initiative utilized the National Justice Database, America's most extensive standardized repository of police behavior data. The project aimed to analyze and visualize policing data to identify and understand disparities in law enforcement practices across different communities.

Using R programming, insightful visualizations were created that shed light on complex datasets, including use of force incidents and vehicle and pedestrian stops. These visualizations provided a clear, accessible means for law enforcement agencies to see disparities and pinpoint areas needing improvement.

The results of this project were comprehensive reports offering actionable recommendations to police departments, aiming to enhance public safety and strengthen community trust and equity. This project not only honed skills in data science and visualization but also highlighted the critical role of transparent, data-driven approaches in advancing social justice.
